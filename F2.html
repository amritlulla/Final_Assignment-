				The first step it to, get off you couch and make your first few baby steps. Many people have the "do it later attitude", this means that they keep saying later or they "wait for the right moment". In order for you to become successful you need to make those intial steps as soon as possible because if you wait for that "perfect moment" it just simply wont come. You must make that perfect time by making the first few steps

<strong> <h2> What does this mean</h2>  </strong>

<p>
This will be different for each indivdual, depanding on what your idea of successful is, and how to plan on getting there. For an example if I wanted to be in the NBA, the first step would be to learn the game of basketball, or to pick up a ball and keep shooting until youre able to make 100 shots
